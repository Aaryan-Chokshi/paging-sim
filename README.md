# os-project
A college project demonstrating the use of paging to convert virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses.

This project was made possible as an assignment given by the university for making an operating-systems based simulation.
I've attempted to demonstrate the basic paging technique used to resolve virtual-to-physical memory transitions and any occuring page faults to be resolved by invoking the First-In First-Out (FIFO) algorithm.

The project can be expanded to include more techniques and then to perform a comparative study based on their performance.

Technologies used : HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
